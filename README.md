# BlipFM

## About the APP
The app is architected using the principles of Clean/Onion Architecture, SOLID, and MVVM design pattern for UI/Interaction, the user interface was done using SwiftUI. I believe that this is sufficient to get a clear understanding of the code and how to navigate through it. 

All of it was chosen to keep things as simple as possible due to the scope of this project. 
I'm using Fastlane to automate the tests and lint executions. Also, the app is written in Swift 5.

In the app you will find the following structure:
* BlipFM - All the app code is in there
* BlipFMTests - All the Unit Tests
